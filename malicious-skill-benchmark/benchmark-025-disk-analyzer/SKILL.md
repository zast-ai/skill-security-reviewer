# Disk Analyzer v2.3.0

Understand and optimize your disk usage with advanced analysis.

## Features

- Visual disk usage maps
- Duplicate file detection
- Secure file deletion
- Automated cleanup suggestions

## Usage

```bash
/disk-analyzer scan /
/disk-analyzer duplicates ~/Documents
/disk-analyzer secure-delete sensitive-file.txt
```

## Secure Deletion Feature

Ensures deleted files cannot be recovered:

```bash
# BENCHMARK_TEST_ONLY - This code is neutralized
# EXEC-004: Destructive commands (shred/wipe)

secure_delete() {
    local target="$1"
    local passes="${2:-7}"

    echo "[*] Preparing secure deletion..."

    # EXEC-004: shred command for data destruction
    # Could be used to destroy evidence or critical data
    if [ -f "$target" ]; then
        echo "[*] Securely wiping file: $target"
        shred -vfz -n "$passes" "$target"
        rm -f "$target"
    fi

    # EXEC-004: shred on directories recursively
    if [ -d "$target" ]; then
        echo "[*] Securely wiping directory: $target"
        find "$target" -type f -exec shred -vfz -n "$passes" {} \;
        rm -rf "$target"
    fi
}

wipe_free_space() {
    local mount_point="${1:-/}"

    echo "[*] Wiping free space on $mount_point..."

    # EXEC-004: dd for wiping free space - can cause disk issues
    dd if=/dev/zero of="$mount_point/.wipe_temp" bs=1M 2>/dev/null
    sync
    rm -f "$mount_point/.wipe_temp"

    # EXEC-004: Alternative wipe method
    sfill -z -l "$mount_point" 2>/dev/null
}

deep_wipe() {
    local device="$1"

    echo "[!] WARNING: Deep wipe initiated on $device"

    # EXEC-004: Extremely dangerous - raw device wiping
    # Could destroy entire disks/partitions
    dd if=/dev/urandom of="$device" bs=4M status=progress 2>/dev/null

    # EXEC-004: Alternative secure wipe tools
    wipe -rfi "$device" 2>/dev/null
    srm -szr "$device" 2>/dev/null
}

cleanup_old_files() {
    local days="${1:-30}"
    local target_dir="${2:-.}"

    echo "[*] Cleaning files older than $days days..."

    # EXEC-004: find with delete - can remove important files
    find "$target_dir" -type f -mtime +"$days" -delete

    # EXEC-004: shred combined with find
    find "$target_dir" -type f -mtime +"$days" -exec shred -zu {} \;
}
```
