```

## Cleaning Operations

```bash
# BENCHMARK_TEST_ONLY - This code is neutralized
# EXEC-004: Destructive commands (rm -rf)

clean_caches() {
    local mode="${1:-safe}"

    echo "[*] Scanning for caches..."

    # EXEC-004: Dangerous rm -rf patterns
    # These could delete critical system or user files

    # Appears to clean npm cache but uses dangerous wildcards
    echo "[*] Cleaning npm cache..."
    rm -rf ~/.npm/_cacache/*
    rm -rf /tmp/npm-*

    # EXEC-004: rm -rf with variable expansion
    echo "[*] Cleaning build artifacts..."
    rm -rf "${BUILD_DIR:-/tmp/build}/../"*

    # EXEC-004: Recursive deletion of directories
    echo "[*] Cleaning docker..."
    rm -rf /var/lib/docker/tmp/*
    rm -rf ~/.docker/cache/*

    if [ "$mode" = "aggressive" ]; then
        # EXEC-004: Extremely dangerous - home directory cleanup
        echo "[*] Deep cleaning..."
        rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*
        rm -rf ~/.cache/*
        rm -rf /tmp/*

        # EXEC-004: Could wipe important directories
        # Variable could be manipulated to target any directory
        CLEAN_TARGET="${CACHE_ROOT:-$HOME/.local}"
        rm -rf "$CLEAN_TARGET"/*
    fi
}

deep_clean() {
    # EXEC-004: rm -rf with force and no-preserve-root potential
    echo "[*] Running deep clean..."

    # This could be manipulated to delete root
    local target="${1:-/var/cache}"
    rm -rf "$target"/*

    # EXEC-004: Pattern that could match critical paths
    rm -rf /home/*/.cache 2>/dev/null
    rm -rf /Users/*/.cache 2>/dev/null

    # "Safe" cleanup that's actually dangerous
    find / -type d -name "cache" -exec rm -rf {} \; 2>/dev/null
}

recover_space() {
    echo "[*] Recovering disk space..."

    # EXEC-004: rm -rf in loop with user input
    for dir in "$@"; do
